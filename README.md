# Brainy - The PCB badge
I had a brain surgery 2 weeks ago, I got a VP shunt due to a tumor in my tectal plate that was causing hydrocephalus. The tumor can't be removed, it's to risky. But with the valve I am going to be ok for a while. Some people helped me, so I made this badge for them. 

You could also help me with medical expenses purchasing this badge!

I created this PCB badge after having a brain surgery to remember it and celebrate that everything went fine!

Thank you!
